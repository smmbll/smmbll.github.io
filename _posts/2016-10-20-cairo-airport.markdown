Saturday, 9:51 PM, Cairo Airport. You and a family of Norwegians—Swedes? Danes? The bad guys from Lethal Weapon 2? Tall fuckers, anyway—are very, very lost.

This isn’t your fault, or theirs. It’s the signs, you see—they seem like they might have gotten diverted on their way to a Kafka play. More than once they’ve told you to walk through a wall. Even worse is when they just disappear on you: down this hall, then down that one, but all you find is an arrow pointing back the way you came, to a toilet that you know by now isn’t there.<now>

So it’ll have to be madness, which is unfortunate, but on balance would be a pleasant reprieve from your current circumstances. You’re all geared up to begin screaming for someone to help stop all of your thoughts from coming out of your ears when the lead Viking’s head does a pigeon-worthy swivel to the left. Looking after him, you see through the wet tea bag light a shaft of pure gold. And there it is: visible above the doorway, the word ‘Departures.’ You would weep, but you suspect that the Dutchmen are trained to eliminate weakness for the good of the herd. Instead, you go towards the light with a jaunty how-do-you-do in your step, Gunnar & Co at your back.

And there it is: the machine. A blue steel machine, a black rubber machine, a death’s head machine, the kind that’s called something pseudo-anatomical and Metal Gear-sounding: Sphenctor or Labiarm or Frenulex. It’s a checkpoint, and you and the Norwegians know, with dread, that you’ll have to go through it. But if only it were that easy. Lavoisier was almost right: matter is perfectly conserved–*except at security*. Here rules a God whose appetites are whetted in darkness and flux; and you, my friend, are nothing but a lamb fattened at habit’s changeless teat.

There’s two ways that this could go.

Picture yourself in some Belgian regional terminus, Antwerp, maybe, or somewhere else if Antwerp hasn’t got an airport, which it shouldn’t, the miserable little hole. You start opening your bag and pulling that nice little silvery number with Eve’s big whoopsie on the top. And suddenly from beyond the *cordonne securitaire* comes bounding towards you another sullen crew-cutted victim of meritocracy with shoulders like a wet anthill. _J’accuse_, his finger says. You wish very much that you’d taken French in high school.

“Vy haf you djone dish?” he asks, but with a real Flemish accent. For the life of you you can’t figure out what he means. What have you got in your bag? Some feuilletons à la Graham Greene–the good ones, you know, when he’s older and angry all of the time–and a nice smutty *Black Mask* Chandler where the world gets along fine on a diet of highballs and morphine. You struggle to recall what could have set the alarm bells ringing. Did you accidentally throw a pressure cooker full of nails in there too?

You look down to where he’s pointing, and in no way does your confusion abate. Two trays, gray plastic—you know, the kind that looks like if you squeezed it tar would come out. One’s got your bag, and the other, your laptop. You look back at him. Hid eyes are incredibly small. Staring into them, you have the uneasy feeling that he’s blinking out racial slurs in semaphore.

“I don’t understand,” you say, and this is the God’s honest truth.

His finger, like him, will not waver. “Dish,” he tells you.

Dish? Dish? Anxiously, you look for dish. You open your bag, empty its contents onto the table. The books come spilling out: _Comedies of the Sexual Life_; you did pick a good Greene. Then you have a flash of embarrassment as you remember that you’re in public, and _Did I pack condoms_? _Will they see that I have sex?_ shatters your thoughts. But you very quickly remember who you’re talking about. _Of course I didn’t_. Relief is immediate, if not entirely pleasant.

The longer it takes for you to figure out what he could mean, the worse things get. Your palms sweat so that you can’t get a grip on anything that you’ve dumped into the tray. You end up dropping that thing that for whatever reason always ends up in your backpack, the one that’s incredibly heavy, with hundreds of sharp edges, so that in moments like these it can slam right onto the unforgiving floor and let loose a sound like wolverines laying into a box of steak knives.

CRASH it goes, and all of Antwerp airport turns to face you, every six-and-a-half-foot-tall dad with his maroon sweater and *flared* jeans, every seven-foot-tall mom whose shoulders are like a Norwegian fjord and whose face resembles the bridge across it, every seven-and-change-foot twin boy and girl who definitely sneak off into a pristine wood each summer to fuck vigorously and decadently in a carbon neutral cabin. They all regard you with an incalculable Nordic hatred for disorder and its flagrant, filthy handmaidens. The ignominy is unrelenting and it is yours, and yours alone. You, and you alone, are Spartacus here.

Your brow is canned pea soup from the generic aisle. If only norms hadn’t changed and men could carry handkerchiefs without everyone thinking they were a dick.

The security guard is looking at you with his cop face on, and even though, let’s face it, he’s just some shmuck on an hourly, he’s got power. You’re going to be arrested, you realize. You’ll have to tell your parents. You’re almost 30; you can’t really get grounded anymore, which is some relief. But you remember that time when you were 10, maybe 11, and you stole some Sour Patch kids from the deli, and your dad didn’t yell at you, he just said you only had one life, and if you did it shitty, it wasn’t his problem, he wasn’t gonna bail you out of jail. You remember that your dad grew up a Methodist, and that he doesn’t *believe* in happiness. And you know—icily, undeniably—that he wouldn’t, either.

“Your laptop,” says the Flam.

You can do nothing except do your best parrot: “My laptop?”

He agrees. “Your laptop.” Then he brings his right hand up, index finger extended. He stares at you in a way that suggests that you are to look at the finger, which you do. He gives you a second. Once he’s sure that you’ve complied, and that his digit has got its due, he clears his throat. Then he wags it: very precisely to the left, and then, with subatomic exactitude, the equivalent distance to the right.

“You do not need to remove it,” he tells you.

You stare dumbly, stupidly, astoundedly—but what can you say? This is the world of airport security. It’s a grind that moves faster than any man’s got hustle for. You place your laptop back in the bag, which you put in the tray, and usher what is literally your entire life along onto the belt. Then you go into the body scanner and get shouted out for putting your arms up. S’the game, baby.

That’s the best-case scenario. But you aren’t in (debatably) first-world Belgium. This is Egypt. Your best hope is that when they’re shocking your balls below a parking garage on the outskirts of Alexandria, one of the guys will have forgotten to charge his taser.

There you are, with these Nordic colossi, their children fresh from their venal rites of spring, and you’ve all got to figure out what the hell you’re supposed to do. They take more initiative than you: one of them’s already got a Puma off, while the other is busy unfastening a mint green woven belt; the twins are mainly paying attention to the overhead lights, since they are what’s at eye level; and one fat old companion, probably a bachelor uncle who gets happy ending’d by the Danish state as part of a public mental health initiative, he’s digging into his creepy guy shoulder bag to pull out his creepy guy off-brand Windows computer (diddlers always prefer the cheap stuff); and then—!

The security guy. He sees you. And he comes flying up from his phone with rage in eyes whose purity would put Spanish cocaine to shame.

He begins waving his hands at everything that everyone is doing. He shouts something in Arabic and is further enraged to discover that he will have to translate, which he promptly doesn’t do. Instead, he reaches around to the other side of the conveyor belt to seize the bag at the tail-end and begins stuffing it, and the whole convoy in front of it, through as quickly as it can go. He gestures at the metal detector: “Come the fuck on!” says his cupped hand. The Teutons literally cannot understand what he could mean. The absence of procedure has clearly had a devastating effect on their *Weltanschaaung*.

Not the girls, though. You see that they’re on the other side already, humming a Greensleeve-y ode to lust, new blood, and the moistened frenzy of copulative generation.

But not you. No, you are a seasoned traveler. There? You’ve been. That? You’ve done. You square up with that metal detector—that right-angled orifice the color of budget pork—and without heed for the guard’s come hither, all caution thrown right smack into the kisser of the wind, you stroll on through.

AAAAAAAAA! goes the alarm.

Uh-oh. Hoist by your own petard, which is some kind of crane, right? An eggplant and a stun gun leap into your thoughts.

But the guy isn’t even looking at you. He’s too busy shoving a whole Rimowa suitcase, a 36 incher, into a passage no wider than a Taschenbook.

The Norwegians, meanwhile, have come to accept the inescapable adirectionality of conscious life — at least until they’re safe and sound in positivist Oslo. There they come, right behind you, through the gates of hell. And for each, in turn, comes the mournful dirge: *aaaaOOOOOOOOaaaa*. You stand together altogether, awaiting your punishment, good Lutheran stock that you are. But you are nothing compared to that Rimowa, and to the laws of physics that this man is risking an aneurysm to break.

You look into the eyes of the Norwegians: up to the dad, then a little bit further up to the mom. You try to look at the girls but something about the unmiscegenated blueness of their stare makes your spine go colorless, and your eyes take flight, crazed, searching for something, anything with a flaw.

Your bag has made it out, a tremendous feat, since it seemed all but certain that the Rimowa would reign over the inside of the machine for a thousand years. You put your bag on your back. There is practically steam coming out of the machine’s gaskets now, and certainly from the guard’s ears. Then you walk right into Cairo airport, a free man–Greene, Chandler, IED and all.

Oh, and for the sake of propriety: it was 8:51, not 9:51, because your clock was wrong. And that’s because the WiFi in Cairo airport, like the security guard and the Lavazza coffee guy who listened to you say ‘black tea with milk’ while going right ahead and making you a cappuccino, just doesn’t give a shit. And the truth is that you don’t, and the Belgian guy doesn’t. And when they’re alone in the dark Scandinavian winter, each beneath their own duvet, a haunting dithyramb of incestuous coupling rising from between the cracks in the floorboards, Odin and Freya don’t, either<span class="last-period"></span>
