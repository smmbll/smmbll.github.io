Saturday, 9:51 PM, Cairo Airport. You sure do get around. Too bad you hardly ever make it out of the airport. Would be nice if you could now—Cairo’s is nothing to write home about, unless home is pretty fucking boring. But there was the security check.

You were  and a family of Norwegians—Swedes? Danes? Afrikaaners? Tall fuckers, anyway—managed to crawl your way through a maze of signage so illogical that it was pushing the boundaries of what, Platonically, could be called a sign, there, in the vestibule beneath the stairs leading to the gates, a little conveyer-belt-and-metal-detector-number was lying in wait for you.

What’s the name for that thing, anyway? It’s already so ubiquitous that you’d think it’d merit some kind of gadget-y pseudo-military shorthand: a Spenctor or a Raimarm or a Frenulex. Whatever: there was one of those things, and you and the Norwegians figured out that you were going to have to go through it. But the catch is that security checkpoints are never a straightforward proposition. They are bound by rituals that are in constant flux: and you, my friend, are a creature who has long supped at habit’s immutable teat.

Take your laptop, for instance. You remove it, right? Of course you do—of course. Until you’re in some Dutch regional terminus, Utrecht, maybe, or somewhere else if Utrecht hasn’t got an airport, and you start opening your bag and pulling that nice little silvery number out (I have a Mac; are you really surprised?)

That’s when—hey, presto!—there appears from beyond the *cordonne securitaire* another sullen crew-cutted victim of meritocracy with shoulders like a wet anthill to loom proletarian over you (or me, anyway; I’m 5’10” and this is Holland).

“Vy haf you djone dish?” he asks, in my best Dutch accent. For the life of you you can’t figure out what he means; were you going to pack some light reading, feuilletons à la Graham Greene, or a nice smutty *Black Mask* Chandler where nothing is so complicated that two adjectives and the word ‘heater’ can’t sort it out, and accidentally—God, I am such a space cadet!—you threw a fertilizer bomb in there instead?

So you look down to where he’s pointing, and in no way does your confusion abate. Two trays, gray plastic—you know, the kind that looks like if you squeezed it tar would come out. One’s got your bag, and the other, your laptop. You look back at him. He’s got incredibly small eyes, doesn’t he, the kind that were made to spot all the perils of the rainbow, and get around political correctness by blinking out epithets in semaphore.

“I don’t understand,” you say, and this is the God’s honest truth.

His finger, like him, is unwavering. “Dish,” he tells you.

Dish? Dish? Anxiously, you look for dish. You open your bag, empty out the contents onto the table; you can hear that he is moving the parts of his body behind you that only ever meet when the moon waxes full over bone-colored presumption. This is bad; your palms sweat; you drop the thing that for whatever reason ended up in your backpack but you didn’t immediately need for the plane, the thing that is always heavy and has sharp edges so that in moments like this one it can slam right into that echoing mocking floor and let loose a sound so godawful that it makes everyone—all of the 6’2”-tall Dutch dads with their thin metal glasses and maroon sweaters and fashion jeans that are too long and are fucking *flared*, and the 6’3”-tall Dutch moms with shoulders like a Norwegian fjord and faces like the bridge across, and the 6’7”-tall supermodel twin son and daughter who definitely sneak off into a pristine wood to fuck vigorously and decadently in a carbon neutral cabin their parents purchased at birth for precisely the purpose—turn around and regard you with an incalculable Nordic hatred for disorder and its flagrant, filthy handmaidens. There are no Spartacuses in this crowd: they’re collaborators through and through. You’re all by your lonesome, to burn in the heat of that flaxen laser beam.

“I don’t—I don’t under—“ you stammer, sounding like an intelligent computer that has watched a healthy mother die for her sick child only to explode at the irrationality of it all, but nobody helps you, nobody explains, or maybe they do say, but they’re speaking fucking Dutch for God’s sake, and who the hell even knows?

The finger that touches your shoulder almost causes your heart to debut a hair-raising rhythmic gymnastic routine whose curve it only realized was too steep on the business end of a career-shuttering fall. “Shur,” he says to you. Shur? Sir? That’s how they talk, right? Does he mean you? It’s got to be. Shit, he’s talking about you. What can you do but turn around?

Your brow is canned pea soup from the generic aisle. If only norms hadn’t changed and men could carry handkerchiefs without everyone thinking they were a dick.

The man is looking at you with his cop face on, and even though, let’s face it, he’s just some shmuck on an hourly, he’s got power, which is what everyone wants and wants no one else to have. You’re going to be arrested, you realize. You’ll have to tell your parents. You’re almost 30; you can’t really get grounded anymore, which is some relief. But you remember that time when you were 10 or maybe 11, and you stole some Sour Patch kids from the deli, and your dad didn’t yell at you, he just said you only had one life, and if you did it shitty, it wasn’t his problem, he wasn’t gonna bail you out of jail. And you remember that your dad grew up a Methodist and doesn’t believe in happiness. And you know—icily, and undeniably—that he wouldn’t, either.

“Your laptop,” says the Dutchman.

You can do nothing except do your best parrot: “My laptop?”

He agrees. “Your laptop.” Then he brings his right hand up, index finger extended. He stares at you in a way that suggests that you are to look at the finger, which you do. He gives you a second. Once he’s sure that you’ve complied, and that his digit has got its due, he clears his throat. Then he wags it: very precisely to the left, and then, with subatomic exactitude, the equivalent distance to the right.

“You do not need to remove it,” he tells you.

You stare dumbly, stupidly, astoundedly—but what can you say? This is the world of airport security. It’s a grind that moves faster than any man’s got hustle for. You place your laptop back in the bag, which you put in the tray, and then usher literally your entire life along onto the belt. Then you go into the body scanner and get shouted out for putting your arms up. S’the game, baby.

Except in Cairo (We’re in Cairo, remember?) There you are, and these Norwegians or Afrikaaners (they’ve got twin gigantic daughters who have definitely gotten into some creepy Germanic kissing games on a duo weekend away at the family cabin) are trying to figure out what they’re supposed to do with this particular avatar of the great god Surveil. One of them’s got one Puma off, the other is busy unfastening a mint green woven belt; the girls are mainly paying attention to the overhead lights, since they’re what’s at eye level; and one fat old companion, probably a bachelor uncle who gets happy ending’d by the Danish state as part of a public mental health initiative, he’s digging into his creepy guy shoulder bag to pull out his creepy guy off-brand Windows computer (diddlers always prefer the cheap stuff); and then—! The security guy comes up from his phone with rage in eyes whose purity would put Spanish cocaine to shame. He begins waving his hands at everything that everyone is doing. He shouts something, in Arabic, and is further enraged to discover that he will have to translate, which he will also not do. Instead, he reaches around to the other side of the conveyor belt to seize the bag at the tail-end and begins stuffing it, and the whole convoy in front, through as quickly as it can go. He gestures at the metal detector: “Come the fuck on!” says his cupped hand. The Norwegians literally cannot understand what he could mean; the absence of procedure has clearly had a devastating effect on their *Weltanschaaung*. Not the girls, though. They’re on the other side already—Did they go through? Were they always there?—humming a sinister Greensleeve-y ode to lust, new blood, and the moistened frenzy of Spring.

But not you. No, you are a seasoned traveler. There? You’ve been. That? You’ve done. You tip your hat to the Dutchman; Mr. Miyagi, too, was a hard teacher. You square up with that metal detector—that right-angled vagina the color of budget pork—and without heed for the beckoning hither of officialdom, all caution balled up like so many failed attempts at list-making and thrown right in the kisser of the wind, you stroll on through.

AAAAAAAAA! goes the alarm.

Uh-oh. You can feel the harness tighten around you as the cable stiffens: hoist by your own petard, which is a kind of crane, you seem to remember. You wait for the shoulders and the crew cut to harrow you like the smug, tertiarily educated residual of the new gilded age that you are.

But you see, this is Cairo airport. The guy hasn’t got time for you. He’s too busy shoving a whole Rimowa suitcase, a 36 incher, into a passage no wider than a Taschenbook.

You’re free?

The Norwegians, meanwhile, have come to accept the inescapable adirectionality of conscious life — at least until they arrive safely back in Oslo. There they come, right behind you, through the gates of hell. And for each, in turn, comes the mournful dirge: *aaaaOOOOOOOOaaaa*. You stand all together on a group tour of limbo, wondering when the fat guy is going to take you to the part about judgment. But that Rimowa, and, really, physics itself, is against him, and he couldn’t care less. You look into the eyes of the Norwegians: up to the dad, then a little bit further up to the mom. You try to look at the girls but something about the unmiscegenated blueness of their stare makes your spine go colorless, and your eyes take flight, crazed, searching for something, anything with a flaw.

Your bag has made it out, a tremendous feat, since the auguries were certain that the Rimowa would annex most of the machine’s interior, and would reign there for a thousand years. You take it one hand, loop it through the other, assume it with your back. Then you walk right into Cairo airport, a free man, Graham Greene, Chandler, fertilizer bomb and all.

Oh, and for the sake of propriety: it was 8:51, not 9:51, because your clock was wrong. And that’s because the WiFi in Cairo airport, like the security and the Lavazza coffee guy who listened to you say ‘black tea with milk’ while going right ahead and making you a cappucino, just doesn’t give a shit.
